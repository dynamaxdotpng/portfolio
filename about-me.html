        Since quite an early age I've been fascinated with how technology enables society to <br>
        communicate and innovate. Even in the last 10 years, since I've really had a sense of the <br>
        world beyond home and school, technology has advanced hugely and it seems this is likely to <br>
        continue. When I was only 13 years old, I took part in the "Young Persons Festival of Code", a <br>
        coding competition held at Plymouth University. My team of 5 produced an app called <a href="code.html">"After Dark"</a> <br>
        which helped children stay safe. We came second in the competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm self sufficient and passionate about a wide range of things. I raised around Â£2,500 for a <br>
        charity trip to Ghana when I was 15. This was part of a school exchange organised relationship <br>
        through the charity Partner Ghana. I visited two schools in Ghana over the course of two <br>
        weeks, living with them and helping them with school infrastructure projects. This was a <br>
        hugely humbling and rewarding experience, helping me understand the opportunity and privilege <br>
        I have. Back in the UK, I have had various part time hospitality jobs, including a managerial <br>
        role in Papa John's Pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of the last year, I've had the privilege to volunteer with Solent NHS <br>
        regularly to help them design web services regarding sexual health information for teens. This <br>
        has really made me aware of the importance of the internet when it comes to educating people, <br>
        especially young people, such as myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a logical mind, I've always found maths straightforward. I've tutored Maths students <br>
      for the last 3 years, helping 5 GCSE students pass their exams and improve their grades. Most <br>
      of my students were predicted to get 3's and sometimes 2's, however, after practising and <br>
      putting in a lot of hard work, they've managed to reach 5's and 6's. This is something that <br>
      makes me incredibly proud, not just from what I managed to assist them with, but the pure <br>
      perseverance that young people can display when they put their minds to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of my T-Level course, I'm currently undertaking work experience with an SME web design <br>
      company. This is improving my understanding of several operating systems and coding languages <br>
      that I've never approached before. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I've completed a course in "Practical Podcasting" at college. This pushed me far out of my <br>
      comfort zone, working with others outside my normal friendship groups to be creative and <br>
      adapting to a branch of software I had never interacted with before.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a young age, I've loved tech and pride myself on questioning how exactly anything and <br>
      everything works. I'm proud to have built and enhanced my own desktop computer at home over <br>
      the last two years. I regularly live stream, and I'm always playing with code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also really enjoy art, anime and all forms of digital creativity. I've combined this hobby <br>
      with streaming on twitch and video editing, and regularly attend Comic Con events with <br>
      friends. Using technology to engage and entertain people is something that I consider <br>
      important because I want everyone around me to be happy and everyone to feel included.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm interested in true crime and I'm also passionate about LGBTQ+ and race equality. Whilst <br>
      technology in general, and social media in particular, can be a force for good, it can also do <br>
      lots of harm to the vulnerable and create mental health issues. There is a dark side to <br>
      technology that worries me and it's something I want to do something about. I find cyber <br>
      security interesting because of the endless positive benefits it can inflict on people's lives <br>
      without them even noticing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology advances can leave the more vulnerable and marginalised behind, and even worse, can <br>
      provide the opportunity for criminals to exploit others, or for hate speech and oppression. I <br>
      feel as if it's the role of my generation to find ways to stop this where we can. My ultimate <br>
      goal is to work in cyber security and computer science to help others in a crime prevention or <br>
      crime detection career, the security services, or possibly even health care.
